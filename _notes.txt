MAILBOXES (iRMX 86â„¢ NUCLEUS REFERENCE MANUAL)
    A mailbox is one of two types of objects that can be used for intertask
    communication. When task A wants to send an object to task B, task A
    must send the object to the mailbox, and task B must visit the mailbox,
    where, if an object isn't there, it has the option of waiting for any
    desired length of time. Sending an object in this manner can achieve
    various purposes. The object might be a segment that contains data
    needed by the waiting task. On the other hand, the segment might be
    blank, and sending it might constitute a signal to the waiting task.
    Another reason to send an object might be to point out the object to the
    receiving task.
